                <h2>What is HTML?</h2>
                <p>
                    HTML(Hyper Text Markup Language) is a language that is used to define the basic structure and content of a web page. It is designed to represent visual content on the screen, in contrast to XML, which defines only abstract data. HTML makes up a part of the "Web Trifecta", which includes HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
                </p>

                <h2>Origin</h2>
                <p>
                    HTML was first conceived in 1989 by computer scientist Tim-Berners Lee, and the first version was released in 1993. Since then, HTML has been released in 5 main versions, the most recent being HTML5(released 2014).

                <h2>How does HTML work?</h2>
                <p>
                    First of all, HTML code must be written in a text editor. It is possible to write it in a simple editor like Notepad or TextEdit, but I recommend <a href="https://notepad-plus-plus.org/">Notepad++</a> for beginners. I do not recommend a professional editor like Adobe Dreamweaver just yet, as it allows one to "cheat" and fill in code, which is not good when first learning a language. In addition to text editors, HTML can be made with a Graphical User Interface(GUI) editor, but it will not be taught in this tutorial.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Once the HTML code has been written, it is now ready to run in a web browser. The purpose of a web browser is to read and display HTML documents. The web browser does this by taking the code and using a rendering engine to convert it into a displayable form.
