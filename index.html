                    Hello, I am Collin Padgett, the creator of this site. I am currently learning programming at the age of 15, and I am more than welcome to share everything that I know so far onto people like me.I made this website to teach new developers like you to get into the right footing into being expert developers. Our main philosophy is that by spending more time into something, you will get much better at what it is that you are learning. So go ahead. Make sure to get the most out of your learning, spend your time as much as you like, kick back, relax, and most importantly, have fun! Remember, if you don't have fun doing something, then what you're doing is not for you! Instead, find something that grinds your gears, even if it isn't computer related.
